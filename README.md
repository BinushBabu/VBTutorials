The RecyclerView widget is a more advanced and flexible version of ListView. This widget is a container for displaying large data sets that can be scrolled very efficiently by maintaining a limited number of views. Use the RecyclerView widget when you have data collections whose elements 
change at runtime based on user action or network events.

Layout managers for positioning items.Default animations for common item operations, such as removal or addition of items
